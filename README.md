# OverTheWire Practice Repository

This repository is dedicated to my practice of cybersecurity and ethical hacking skills via the website OverTheWire. 

## Introduction

In this repository, I document my progress and solutions to the challenges I encounter on OverTheWire. By practicing cybersecurity and ethical hacking techniques, I aim to improve my skills in identifying vulnerabilities, securing systems, and understanding the mindset of potential attackers. Plus, it's a fun way to learn and apply new concepts in a safe and legal environment.
